# Subtle Bash Script Error in Return Status Handling

This repository demonstrates a common and subtle error in bash scripting:  incorrect handling of the return status of a command. The script attempts to process a file, but may fail to correctly detect and report errors.

The `bug.sh` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.sh` file provides a corrected version.

This illustrates the importance of carefully checking return statuses in bash scripts, especially when dealing with operations that might fail.
